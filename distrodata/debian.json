    "desc": "# Debian\nDebian is a versatile and stable Linux distribution that forms the foundation for various other popular distributions. Known for its commitment to free and open-source software principles, Debian provides a robust and reliable operating system suitable for servers, desktops, and embedded systems. With a focus on stability, security, and adherence to the Debian Free Software Guidelines, it has become a cornerstone in the Linux ecosystem.\n\nDebian's roots trace back to 1993 when Ian Murdock envisioned a distribution that would be open, community-driven, and dedicated to the principles of the Free Software Movement. Since then, Debian has evolved into a robust and diverse project with a strong emphasis on inclusivity, diversity, and collaboration.\n\n## Features and Philosophy\nDebian follows the philosophy of providing a truly free and open-source operating system. It prioritizes users' freedom and aims to ensure that users can modify, distribute, and share the software. The Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines outline the project's commitment to these principles.\n\nOne of Debian's distinguishing features is its package management system. The Advanced Package Tool (APT) simplifies the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages. It ensures smooth dependency resolution, making it easy for users to manage software on their systems.\n\nDebian supports a wide range of hardware architectures, making it suitable for various devices, from personal computers to servers and embedded systems. The stability of Debian makes it a preferred choice for servers and critical environments where reliability is paramount.",
